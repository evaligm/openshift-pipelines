1- install openshift gitops operator - REQUIREMENT FOR APPDEV CI/CD PIPELINE WORK
	operator hub

2- give argocd service the ability to manage the cluster - REQUIREMENT FOR APPDEV CI/CD PIPELINE WORK
	oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin -z openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller -n openshift-gitops

3 - grab argocd web console password: - REQUIREMENT FOR APPDEV CI/CD PIPELINE WORK
	argoPass=$(oc get secret openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.data.admin\.password}' | base64 -d)
	
	copy the generated password
4- login to argocd cluster
	username: admin
	password: the one copied from step 3

5- create argocd application resource
	"Application kind" in ArgoCD is a managed collection of manifest files, mainly composed of 4 parts:
		
		spec:
		  destination: # where we define the destinaiton cluster of the deployment
		  namespace:
		  server:
		project: # name of the argocd project, NOT the openshift/kubernetes namespace 
		source: # the source of truth (git repo) where argocd should pick up and deploy the yaml files
		  path:
		  repoUrl:
		  targetRevision:
		syncPolicy: # the way in which argocd should automate the deploy process
		  automated:
		    prune: [true/false] # auto remove resources that were deleted from the git repo
		    selfHeal: [true/false] # auto update deployed resources if discrepancy found with git repo 
		    syncOptions:
		      - CreateNamespace=true
		      
6- run argocd application
	oc apply -f argo-application.yaml
